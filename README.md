Bounty 1: Depeg Monitor
<details>
(Copy and paste of Hacken's Depeg Monitor bounty)

Detector should be configured on a Token contract which is has a peg to another token or a value (e.g. stablecoin, Liquid staking, LRT)
Detector should monitor for token price deviation from an safe range.
Detector should generate event for out of range condition.

üóÇÔ∏è Bounty Category
On-chain Security

üí∞ Prize Amount

ü•á Number of Projects Awarded

üèÜ Winner Breakdown
1st place: $1000

üìù Requirements
Teams must develop a Depeg Monitor capable of detecting stablecoin and pegged asset deviations.
The solution should:

Be configured on a token contract that maintains a peg (e.g., stablecoins, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)).
Define a safe range threshold for price variations and trigger an event when the token price falls outside this range.
Use the Sentinel SDK (GitHub).
‚úÖ What does a successful project look like?
Detector successfully detects
depeg

of an asset in a configured interval and generates an Alert with metadata describing depeg
üé® UI/UX Design Requirements
No front-end is required, the solution should be a command-line tool that runs autonomously.
Must be packaged in Docker or as a standalone executable for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è How are we judging it?
How well does the detector identify depegging events?
Are the alerts timely and reliable with minimal false positives?
Is the code well-structured, efficient, and documented for easy maintenance and further development?
How well is the Sentinel SDK integrated?
üåé Impact on the organization
Stablecoin depegging has caused big losses and financial instability in DeFi.A Depeg Monitor would provide real-time alerts, improving security and risk management for DeFi protocols, and liquidity providers. This tool will help protect on-chain assets by identifying risks before they escalate, making DeFi safer for all participants.

Example: https://github.com/haas-labs/ext-sentinel-py-sdk/blob/main/examples/block_tx

üëÄ Some example use cases
We are looking for proof-of-concept implementations that demonstrate a clear approach to detecting and reporting depegging events. For example: Track USDT, USDC, DAI, and other stablecoins against their pegged value to provide early warnings before major depegs occur.

üíº Recruitment Opportunities
We are always looking for talented developers who are passionate about blockchain security. If your work on this bounty demonstrates strong technical skills and an understanding of real-time blockchain event detection, we encourage you to explore opportunities with our team.

Bounty 2: AI Smart Contract Auditor 
<details>
(Copy and paste of Hacken's AI Smart Contract Auditor bounty)

ÔøΩÔøΩ Requirements
The goal of this bounty is to develop an AI-powered security agent that detects vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. The agent should be open-source, self-hostable, and capable of continuous learning using real-world security audit data.
The MVP must feature a chat-based interface, allowing users to submit smart contracts via text input or GitHub integration for automated scanning. The AI model should be pre-trained on real audit reports and security vulnerabilities to ensure high accuracy.

‚úÖ What does a successful project look like?
A successful implementation of this bounty will result in a fully functional, AI-powered smart contract security auditor that can:
‚úÖ Analyze Solidity smart contracts through a chat-based interface or GitHub repository integration
‚úÖ Detect security vulnerabilities using static analysis + AI reasoning
‚úÖ Provide actionable reports that classify risks and suggest mitigations
‚úÖ Be self-hostable and extendable, allowing further training on private datasets

üé® UI/UX Design Requirements
The application must have a functional user interface, which can be:

A chat-based interface (web-app, CLI, or messaging bot).
A browser-based dApp that allows users to submit smart contracts for analysis.
For browser-based interfaces:
Must be publicly accessible via a demo URL.
Should include an input field for pasting Solidity code and an option to connect a GitHub repository.
Results must be displayed clearly with vulnerability classifications and explanations.
For command-line applications:
Must be packaged in a Docker container for easy deployment.
Should support Linux/MacOS environments.

üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è How are we judging it?
Success Criteria
1. AI-Powered Smart Contract Security Analysis (40%)

‚úÖ Successfully accepts Solidity code and GitHub repositories as input.
‚úÖ Identifies common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflows, access control issues, logic bugs).
‚úÖ Uses a combination of static analysis tools (Slither, Semgrep, Foundry) + AI-based reasoning for enhanced accuracy.
‚úÖ Provides explanations and context for each detected vulnerability.
2. AI Model Training & Security Knowledge (30%)
‚úÖ Model is pre-trained on real-world audit reports provided in JSON/CSV format.
‚úÖ Demonstrates understanding of security best practices by correctly classifying vulnerabilities.
‚úÖ Supports additional training with new security datasets, allowing continued improvement.
3. Deployment & Usability (20%)
‚úÖ Can be self-hosted on a VPS with a Docker-based deployment.
‚úÖ Includes clear documentation on how to install, configure, and extend the system.
‚úÖ Outputs reports in JSON, PDF, or Markdown format, making them easy to integrate into security workflows.
4. Innovation & Scalability (10%)
‚úÖ Allows future customization by supporting additional datasets for fine-tuning.
‚úÖ Demonstrates potential for integration into security pipelines for continuous auditing.
‚úÖ Shows creative ways to enhance AI-powered vulnerability detection beyond static analysis.
Example of a Successful Submission
A team submits a project where:

Users can paste Solidity code or connect a GitHub repo via a chat-based interface.
The AI agent scans the smart contract using static analysis + AI-powered reasoning to detect vulnerabilities.
The system outputs a structured security report with severity classifications and suggested fixes.
The pre-trained model leverages real-world audit data, improving its detection capabilities.
The project is fully self-hostable on a VPS and can be further trained with additional datasets.
Projects that meet or exceed these expectations will be eligible for the $7,000 (1st place) and $3,000 (2nd place) prizes.

## Setup for depeg event detector 
Setup `sentinel` ([link to official guide](https://github.com/haas-labs/ext-sentinel-py-sdk/blob/main/docs/Install/Virtualenv.md))

```bash
# Clone SDK
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/haas-labs/ext-sentinel-py-sdk.git
cd ext-sentinel-py-sdk

# Create virtual environment
# (so dependencies does not interfere with your system's)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install
./scripts/install all

# Test if `sentinel` is working correctly
# If it works, there should be some text about how to use `sentinel`
sentinel --help
```

Next, we'll run `sentinel` with our depeg event detector.

```bash
#export DEV_TRANSACTION_WS_URI=ws://proxy:9300

# Using Anvil (from Foundry) for local blockchain testing but have not figured out how to test the detector
# export DEV_TRANSACTION_WS_URI=ws://127.0.0.1:8545

sentinel launch --profile depeg-detector/profile.yaml

# sentinel launch --profile depeg-detector/profile.yaml --env-vars .envs/local.yml --rich-logging
```

## Setup for audit agent  (incomplete yet, did not submit)
Setup `uv`, a Python package and project manager ([link to official guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation))

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

cd audit-agent
uv run agent.py
```
